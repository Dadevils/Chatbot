Hey you eagles what yo doin today 
Oh I am just chilling in the chill chat ...
Oh yeah me too, do you also cant see the channels, except the level chats 
Oh yeah same, I dont know whats going on there 
Did you heard about Bored Bunny
Yeah, they seem like a scam right?
Yes they are... seems very strange 
Hm... got to keep up nowerdays.
Thats what I love about Eagles and Bulls and so...
Yeah, its always extremely cool when the artist is not anonymous 
Oh man I generally just love the 3D Art... 
Yeah that realistic touch makes the art look so amazing 
Do you know Prime Ape Planet, they also had pretty nice artwork 
Of course, they look huge
I also liked Boonji Project, but not so much 
Hm... alright so do you like Pixel art?
I do 
Hm I am not so much into it.. acutally 
So you dont like CyberKongz
Arent these those NFTs that bring you Passive Income 
Hm so that sounds nice... they generate these bananas, arent they
You know I am alsways wondering how these tokens got changed against ETH
Hm I think there is always offer and demand 
Hm with these weird coins ?
Yeah even with those... there are people out there that want to gamble
There are?
Yeah... there was for example this SOS Token you could claim for your Opensea activity that one made 10x in 24 hours 
Wow thats impressive
Also I think that generally the firm always buys the tokens, since they are collecting fees 
Hm that makes sense 
Well but you are right these business models are pretty interesting 
You mean pancake swap 
Exactly 
Where did you buy your ETH and else? 
I bought them on Binance and you?
I used Coinbase 
Oh I love Coinbases interface 
Yeah ik, Binance is too professional xD
